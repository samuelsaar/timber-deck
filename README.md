# Timber Deck

A Raspberry Pi 5 based portable computer. Built inside a small wooden box with a custom mechanical keyboard, 7" IPS touch display, a speaker and I/O that's... workable at least.

## Why?

Custom portable computers are simply cool, I have been wanting to make one for the past couple of years. It might also become the machine I tinker with Linux on, I daily drive Linux on my desktop, but I don't feel like messing around with that install too much as I need it to just work. It might also be an interesting experiment to try and use this in place of my actual laptop.
