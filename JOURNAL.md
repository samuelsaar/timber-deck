I stumbled on an old Soviet era wooden box which, probably used for storing lab equipement, happenes to have just enough room to house a small 5 row keyboard.

Inspired by this, I have decided to turn this box into a little personal computer cyberdeck thing. From the looks of things it shouldn't be too hard to fit a raspberry pi 5, a ~50% keyboard, a battery and a screen in this box.

Today was mostly spent modelling and experimenting with different designs in Blender.
