# 25-06-2025 - Idea and Inital Design

**I stumbled on an old Soviet era wooden box which, originally probably used for storing lab equipement, happenes to now have just enough room to house a small 5 row keyboard.**

**Inspired by this, I have decided to turn this box into a little personal computer cyberdeck thing. From the looks of things it shouldn't be too hard to fit a raspberry pi 5, a custom ~50% keyboard, a battery and a 7" screen in this, maybe even a speaker, we'll see.**

**Today was mostly spent modelling and experimenting with different concepts in Blender. The dimensions of things is roughly correct, but it's far from a functional design.**

### Total time ~6h

# 26-06-2025 - Not much

**Had a lot of other stuff going on so couldn't work on the project much. I researched my options for power and display and started making a bill of materials.**

**The power situation seems a bit more complicated than I initally figured as the Pi 5 needs 5V 5A over USB-C, while it is a standard that exists, it isn't one that anyone uses... Going with a power bank that can output 25W at a higher voltage and then using a buck converter to get it down to 5V 5A seems to be the simplest and most economical option. There are also some UPS HATs that take 18650 cells and output 5V 5A, those might also be worth considering.**
